ingredients:
  - 453 grams medium firm tofu
  - 1/8 tsp salt
  - 6 grams ginger
  - 6 grams garlic (grated)
  - 1/4 cup mirin
  - 2 tbs soy sauce
  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  - 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds
  - Scallion green (garnish)

directions:
  - Drain the tofu on a wire rack for at least one hour.
  - Set the tofu on a few layers of paper towels and cut it into 9 cubes.
  - Sprinkle them evenly on all sides with the salt.
  - Grate ginger into a pan and then gather up the pulp and squeeze out as much juice as you can in to the pan. Discard the pulp .
  - Add the grated garlic, mirin, soy sauce, and black pepper to the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil and continue boiling until the sauce just starts to thicken and it no longer smells like alcohol (about a minute after it comes to a full boil). Transfer the sauce to a bowl and set aside.
  - To fry the tofu, heat 2-inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot until it reaches 360 degrees F (180 C). Pat the tofu dry on all sides with fresh paper towels and carefully lower the tofu into the hot oil using tongs.
  - Fry the tofu undisturbed for about 5-6 minutes or until you’re able to pull the tofu away from the bottom of the pot without breaking it. Flip the tofu over and let it continue frying for another 5-6 minutes or until it’s golden brown on all sides.
  - Transfer the hot tofu straight into the bowl with the sauce and sprinkle on the sesame seeds. Toss to coat the tofu with glaze and then transfer the tofu to a serving plate.
  - Garnish with more sesame seeds, black pepper, and chopped scallion greens.

  - Add butter to warm macaroni and mix until melted. Season with the remaining salt and pepper.
  - Add 1 cup of cheddar, mozzarella, provolone, Gouda, and feta cheese. Mix well.
  - Add eggs and evaporated milk, mix until fully incorporated.
  - Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with the remaining cheddar cheese.
  - Bake in a preheated oven for 40–45 minutes, until the top has nicely browned.
