ingredients:
  - 4 cups chicken stock
  - 1 tbs vegetable oil
  - 3 tbs butter, divided 
  - 1 medium shallot, chopped (about 1/2 cup; or 1/2 small onion, chopped)
  - 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
  - 1/2 cup dry vermouth (or dry white wine)
  - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped
  - Kosher salt, to taste

directions:
  - In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. Lower the heat so the stock stays hot while you cook the risotto.
  - In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly translucent.
  - Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that the grains are coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another minute or so, until there is a slightly nutty aroma. But don't let the rice turn brown. 
  - Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is fully absorbed. 
  - Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir until the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process. 
  - Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for 20 to 30 minutes or until the grains are tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy (al dente). 
  - Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Season to taste with kosher salt.

notes: #extra info about the recipe --- must be a list!
  - When you add a ladle of broth or wine to the risotto, make sure that you wait until the risotto has almost completely absorbed the liquid and the rice is nearly dry before you add the next ladle.
  - It's important to stir constantly, especially while the hot stock gets absorbed, to prevent scorching.
  - If you run out of stock and the risotto is still crunchy, finish cooking it with hot water. Add the water a ladle at a time, stirring while it's absorbed.
